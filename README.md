I‚Äôm Jeet Jayas, a Computer Science senior at Purdue University specializing in Machine Intelligence and Data Mining. With a solid foundation in software development and a keen interest in algorithm optimization and machine learning, I enjoy building innovative solutions that bridge the gap between theory and real-world applications.

My projects range from custom shell implementations and full-stack web development to machine learning models and data analysis tools. I'm proficient in a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including Python, Java, C, Django, React, and SQL.

### üöÄ What I do:
- Develop full-stack applications using modern frameworks and technologies.
- Optimize algorithms and implement machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- Contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with fellow developers to solve complex problems.
- Apply systems programming knowledge to build efficient and scalable software solutions.

### üî≠ Currently working on:
- A Naive Black-Scholes Model-based stock prediction tool in Python.
- Enhancing a Django-based blogging platform for the Purdue community.
- Exploring advanced data structures and algorithms in my role as a Teaching Assistant.

### üéì Education:
- **Purdue University** | B.S. in Computer Science (Expected Graduation: December 2025)
- Certificate in Applications in Data Science
